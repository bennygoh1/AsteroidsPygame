# AsteroidsPygame
My game Asteroids from scratch but actually written in python.

# Description
I want to rewrite the game in python. I also want to make it nicer and more features for the game since Python is more flexible and more functinality than scratch.

# Release Date
Until i am done. Will probably take a month to do so since i am busy with IRL stuffs.
